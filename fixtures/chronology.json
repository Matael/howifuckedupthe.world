In 1971, he took charge of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump & Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated, and managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name in the branding of various products. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted The Apprentice, a reality television series on NBC. As of 2016, Forbes listed him as the 324th wealthiest person in the world and 113th richest in the United States, with a net worth of $4.5 billion.\r\nTrump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election, and quickly emerged as the front-runner among 17 contenders in the Republican primaries. His final opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention along with Mike Pence as his running mate. His campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false.\r\nTrump won the presidential election on November 8, 2016, against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and assumed office on January 20, 2017. Elected at age 70, he is the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency; the first without prior military or governmental service; and the fifth elected with less than a plurality of the national popular vote.\r\nTrump's platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.\u2013China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. He advocates a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to preempt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIS. His positions have been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist, and nationalist.", "wiki_pagename": "Donald Trump", "functions": [7, 8]}}, {"model": "Chronology.person", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "Adolf Hitler", "wiki_summary": "Adolf Hitler (German: [\u02c8ad\u0254lf \u02c8h\u026atl\u0250]; 20 April 1889 \u2013 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and F\u00fchrer (\"Leader\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.\nHitler was born in Austria, then part of Austria-Hungary, and raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the NSDAP, in 1919 and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923 he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.\nBy 1933 the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, which led to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the effective abandonment of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans\u2014actions which gave him significant popular support.\nHitler sought Lebensraum (\"living space\") for the German people in Eastern Europe. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned.\nUnder Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (\"sub-humans\") and socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare, and constitutes the deadliest conflict in human history.", "wiki_pagename": "Adolf Hitler", "functions": [9, 11]}}, {"model": "Chronology.person", "pk": 4, "fields": {"name": "Nicolas Sarkozy", "wiki_summary": "Nicolas Sarkozy (French: [ni.k\u0254.la sa\u0281.k\u0254.zi]; born Nicolas Paul St\u00e9phane Sark\u00f6zy de Nagy-Bocsa; 28 January 1955) is a French politician who served as the President of France and ex officio Co-Prince of Andorra from 16 May 2007 until 15 May 2012.\nBefore his presidency, he was the leader of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party.

Hollande also served in the National Assembly of France twice for the department of Corr\u00e8ze's 1st Constituency from 1988 to 1993, and again from 1997 to 2012.\nHollande was born in Rouen and raised in Neuilly-sur-Seine. He began his political career as a special advisor to newly elected President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, before serving as a staffer for Max Gallo, the government's spokesman. After a brief stint as a municipal councillor for Ussel, he was elected as the country's inaugural First Secretary of the Socialist Party. After the triumph of the left in the 2004 regional elections, Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, and resigned as First Secretary and was immediately elected to replace Jean-Pierre Dupont as the president of the General Council of Corr\u00e8ze in 2008. In 2011, Hollande announced that he would be a candidate in the primary election to select the Socialist Party presidential nominee; he won the nomination and on 6 May 2012, he was elected President with 51.7% of the vote.\nDuring his tenure, Hollande legalized same-sex marriage by passing Bill no. 344, reformed labor furlough and credit training programs, withdrew French combat troops present in the Afghanistan military intervention, concluded a E.U. directive through a Franco-German contract and led the country through the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. He was a leading proponent of NATO\u2019s 2011 military intervention in Libya and has sent troops to Mali and the Central African Republic. Some of his actions and opinions regarding EU mandatory migrant quotas, the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, Brexit, and the proposed constitutional amendment regarding the removal of French citizenship from suspected terrorists, have drawn domestic and international controversy. As a member of the G8, Hollande has struggled to revive the economy of France in ways that sparked long-term economic stimulus by increasing taxes and seeing unemployment up to 10% as of December 2016, however his economic policies have secured France as the most toured country in the world and consolidated France's status as a nation of open markets, regulatory efficiency, rule of law and limited governmental intervention.\nHollande's approval ratings have fluctuated wildly during his time as president: upon being elected he was one of the most popular heads-of-state in the European Union with a nearly 60% approval rating. Due to lack of economic development and domestic troubles over his tenure he has faced spikes and downturns in approval rates ultimately making him one of the most unpopular presidents in the country's history.
